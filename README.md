# Abandoned

I am no longer using the AWS server I was trying to automate with this template, so this is incomplete and will probably stay that way.

## bigfix-cloudformation-template

Work in progress

python code to generate an AWS CloudFormation Template for a BigFix/IEM evaluation root server with resources that fit within the AWS free tier. 

This is an example use of the https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere library.
